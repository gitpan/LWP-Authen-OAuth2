        *sigh*  My machine was not running all of the tests that module
        starter installed.  Other environments did, and therefore failed.
        Removed or fixed those.  (Really, I do not want to have end user
        documentation in subclasses of parent methods that they were
        supposed to override.)

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world with much
        documentation and no useful tests.
